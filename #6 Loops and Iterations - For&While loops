'''simple for - loop, will end on number 3'''
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for num in nums:
    if num == 3:
        print('We found it!')
        break
    print(num)
'''example with continue sequence'''
for num in nums:
    if num == 3:
        print('We found it!')
        continue
    print(num)

'''loop which gives every combination of those numbers and characters'''
for num in nums:
    for letter in 'abc':
        print(num, letter)

'''simple including of the chosen number'''
for i in range(1, 11, 2):
    print(i)

'''simple example of using while loop'''
x= 0

while x < 10:
    if x == 5:
        break
    print (x)
    x+=1

'''using true conditional'''
while True:
    if x == 5:
        break
    print(x)
    x+=1
